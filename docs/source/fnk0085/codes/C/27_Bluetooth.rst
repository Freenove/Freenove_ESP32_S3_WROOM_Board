Component knowledge
==============================

ESP32-S3's integrated Bluetooth function Bluetooth is a short-distance communication system, which can be divided into two types, namely Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) and Classic Bluetooth. There are two modes for simple data transmission: master mode and slave mode.

Master mode
-------------------------------

In this mode, works are done in the master device and it can connect with a slave device. And we can search and select slave devices nearby to connect with. When a device initiates connection request in master mode, it requires information of the other Bluetooth devices including their address and pairing passkey. After finishing pairing, it can connect with them directly.

Slave mode
---------------------------------

The Bluetooth module in slave mode can only accept connection request from a host computer, but cannot initiate a connection request. After connecting with a host device, it can send data to or receive from the host device.

Bluetooth devices can make data interaction with each other, as one is in master mode and the other in slave mode. When they are making data interaction, the Bluetooth device in master mode searches and selects devices nearby to connect to. When establishing connection, they can exchange data. When mobile phones exchange data with ESP32-S3, they are usually in master mode and ESP32-S3 in slave mode.

Lightblue
---------------------------

If you can't install Serial Bluetooth on your phone, try LightBlue.If you do not have this software installed on your phone, you can refer to this linkï¼šhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/lightblue/id557428110#?platform=iphone.

Step1. Upload the code of Project 03.1 to ESP32-S3.

Step2. Click on serial monitor.

    :align: center

Step3. Set baud rate to 115200.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_04.png
    :align: center

Turn ON Bluetooth on your phone, and open the Lightblue APP. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_05.png
    :align: center

In the Scan page, swipe down to refresh the name of Bluetooth that the phone searches for. Click ESP32S3_Bluetooth.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_06.png
    :align: center

Click "Receive". Select the appropriate Data format in the box to the right of Data Format. For example, HEX for hexadecimal, utf-string for character, Binary for Binary, etc. Then click SUBSCRIBE.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_07.png
    :align: center

Back to the serial monitor on your computer. You can type anything in the left border of Send, and then click Send. 

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_08.png
    :align: center

And then you can see the mobile Bluetooth has received the message.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_09.png
    :align: center

Similarly, you can select "Send" on your phone. Set Data format, and then enter anything in the sending box and click Write to send.

.. image:: ../_static/imgs/27_Bluetooth/Chapter27_10.png
    :align: center

And the computer will receive the message from the mobile Bluetooth.

And now data can be transferred between your mobile phone and computer via ESP32-S3 WROOM.

The following is the program code:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/C/Sketches/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :dedent:

Define the specified UUID number for BLE vendor.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/C/Sketches/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :lines: 18-20
    :dedent:

Write a Callback function for BLE server to manage connection of BLE.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/C/Sketches/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :lines: 22-30
    :dedent:

Write Callback function with BLE features. When it is called, as the mobile terminal send data to ESP32-S3, it will store them into reload.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/C/Sketches/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :lines: 32-42
    :dedent:

Initialize the BLE function and name it.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/C/Sketches/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :lines: 61-61
    :dedent:

When the mobile phone send data to ESP32-S3 via BLE Bluetooth, it will print them out with serial port; 

When the serial port of ESP32-S3 receive data, it will send them to mobile via BLE Bluetooth.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../freenove_Kit/C/Sketches/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART/Sketch_03.1_BLE_USART.ino
    :linenos: 
    :language: c
    :lines: 65-78
    :dedent:

The design for creating the BLE server is:

1. Create a BLE Server

2. Create a BLE Service

3. Create a BLE Characteristic on the Service

4. Create a BLE Descriptor on the characteristic

5. Start the service.

6. Start advertising.
